# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Preforming an analysis on the Kickstarter data that we were provided. Th kickstarter data was an assortment of different media outlets  and how that media whether it be tv, a play or show did in a specific county based off of its goal and what the ending outcome was. Whether or not it was a success, failure or simply canceled. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how many projects failed, were successful and were canceled based off of what the initial goal was and what was actually raised. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge came when doing the outcomes sheet. I was trying to find a way to be effiecient and not have to retype the formula for each row  withut messing it up. It took me a few tries to get it down. The line graph for the percentages for some reason was challenging as well. I could not get it to look like your example picture which let me know my data was wrong. So I tried my best to try and fix it and find where the error was.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- The first conclusion that I can draw from the data is that the most output of media categories seemed to be during the summertime and because of that those months also had the highest succesfull numbers. I am assuming because most people have more time during the summer to get out , especially for those that are in school or simply trying to enjoy the nice weather. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-  What I can see by looking at the data and graph is that when we get around the 15000 to 19999 range  the data becomes even and starts to level off. But then after that the amuount of failed goals begins to increase more than than the amount of  goals that are successfull. There are two outliers in the 35000 to 39999 and the 40000 to 44999 range brining success rates higher than any other range but I would conclude that if  you want to meet a steady goal possibly all year long staying in the 15000 to 19999 and below range will give you the highest success rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- The limitations are seeing the data as a whole and not breaking it down any further and going in by country/area because geo placement does make a difference.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Another table/chart we could look into is the average donation  compared to the goal and success/failure rate.  For instance  when the goal was lower were higher donations made and vice versa? Another table to look at would be the types of media and their success/failure during a year. For instance do plays do better in the winter months or television .
