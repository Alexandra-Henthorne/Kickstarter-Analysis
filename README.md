# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Preforming an analysis on the Kickstarter data that we were provided. Th kickstarter data was an assortment of different media outlets  and how that media whether it be tv, a play or show did in a specific county based off of its goal and what the ending outcome was. Whether or not it was a success, failure or simply canceled. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how many projects failed, were successful and were canceled based off of what the initial goal was and what was actually raised.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge came when doing the outcomes sheet. I was trying to find a way to be effiecient and not have to retype the formula for each row  withut messing it up. It took me a few tries to get it down. The line graph for the percentages for some reason was challenging as well. I could not get it to look like your example picture which let me know my data was wrong. So I tried my best to try and fix it and find where the error was.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
